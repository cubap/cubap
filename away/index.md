# Limited Availability

Thank you for reaching out, but I am not available.

I began parental leave on 16 November 2022 and have very limited availability until 9 January 2023. If there are any unexpected changes to that schedule, I will post it here.

## In my absence,

Most concerns can be addressed directly to the Research Computing Group at research.computing@slu.edu. My supervisor is Maureen Donlin. If I have existing projects with you, please refer to our previous communications to discover which colleague may be the best contact for you. 

I will be checking messages, but you should expect at least a week delay. It is possible to schedule meetings in person or on line, but I thank you in advance for your patience.

## Updates

There are none yet, I just left!
